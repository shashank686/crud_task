# crud_task

1. Used Cron to achieve automatic deletion after given time.

2. Alternative way can be using setInterval for now I have commented that setInterval code.

3. Please Use m for minutes ex 30m ,h for hours 3h ,d for days ex 3d ,while passing string to duration.

5. While clicking on Add task it will trigger a POST request and you will get back the document created in mongodb in form of json please use Json formattor for better experience.

6. On clicking on Get All Tasks it will trigger a GET request and you will get back all the documents which are up to date in mongoDB.
